\title{Takes the metadata from the file and performs correlation analysis based on the disease measure the user chooses}
\usage{
cor_work(file, metadata, patient_factor)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{the csv file that contains the omics data. Rownames should be in format, condition_1. First column should include the binary sample conditions.}

\item{metadata}{another csv file that contains the patient metadata, including patient factors and disease measures that are to be investigated}

\item{patient_factor}{the patient variable against which the omic features will be correlated.}
}
\value{
Returns \link{1} table of correlation statistics \link{2} scatter plots showing the features significantly correlated with the patient factor or disease measure.
Regression line and appropriate statistical tests are also included in the plot
}
\description{
Takes the metadata from the file and performs correlation analysis based on the disease measure the user chooses
}
\examples{
## Read data from a CSV file
file <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "example_data.csv", package = "markerHuntR"))
metadata <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "example_patient_metadata.csv", package = "markerHuntR"))
cor_plot <- cor_work(file, metadata, patient_factor)

## Alternatively, provide a data frame directly
file <- data.frame(...)
cor_plot <- cor_work(file, metadata, patient_factor)

}

\title{Performs principal components analysis from the omics datafile imported}
\usage{
pca_work(file, metadata, patient_factor)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{the csv file that contains the omics data. Rownames should be in format, condition_1. First column should include the binary sample conditions.}

\item{metadata}{another csv file that contains the patient metadata, including patient factors and disease measures that are to be investigated}

\item{patient_factor}{the patient variable against which the omic features will be correlated.#'}
}
\value{
Returns a PCA plot with the samples labelled based on the binary conditions from the dataset.

## Read data from a CSV file
file <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "example_data.csv", package = "markerHuntR"))
pca_plot <- pca_work(file, metadata, patient_factor)

## Alternatively, provide a data frame directly
file <- data.frame(...)
pca_plot <- pca_work(file, metadata, patient_factor)

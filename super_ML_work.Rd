\title{Complete workflow for the supervised machine learning approach for generating a panel of analytes that discriminate two sample conditions.
super_ML_work provides the complete analysis of the omics dataset imported as a csv file}
\usage{
super_ML_work(
  file = file,
  metadata_df = metadata_df,
  patient_factor = patient_factor,
  train_test_split = train_test_split,
  number_features = number_features,
  algorithm = algorithm
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{the csv file that contains the omics data. Rownames should be in format, condition_1. First column should include the binary sample conditions.}

\item{metadata_df}{another csv file that contains the patient metadata, including patient factors and disease measures that are to be investigated}

\item{patient_factor}{the patient variable against which the omic features will be correlated.#'}

\item{train_test_split}{the modelling involves a holdout cross validation approach, involving the splitting of the data into training and testing splits.
This designates the proportion used to train the model.}

\item{number_features}{User can provide a number of features to include in the model, generally based on the large_fs from the feature selection.}

\item{algorithm}{User can designate the supervised machine learning algorithm used in the final model. Generally selected from the best performing algorithm shown in the ROC curves and table.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\describe{
\item{large_fs}{A bar plot showing the top 20 features from the feature selection process. Used to select the number of features.}
\item{ft_actual}{A bar plot showing the selected features for the final model. Model was trained on 80\% of the dataset, and evaluated in 20\%.}
\item{trainn_2}{The reduced dataframe containing the condition column and selected features}
\item{met_table}{A table showing the performance metrics from seven commonly used supervised machine learning algorithms for the binary classification}
\item{met_roc}{A plot of the ROC curves for each supervised machine learning algorithms. Complements the table showing the performance metrics}
\item{met_modell}{The final tuned model with 10-fold cross validation repeated 10 times.}
\item{final_roc_met}{The ROC curve for the final model evaluated within the test subset.}
\item{partials}{Model-agnostic feature interpretation plots showing the inner workings of the model. Partial dependence plot and accumulated local effects plot shown for each feature.}
\item{actuals}{Boxplots of the selected features' abundances/expression across the sample conditions. T-tests/Wilcoxon tests performed depending on the distribution of the features.}

\examples{
## Read data from a CSV file
file <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "example_data.csv", package = "markerHuntR"))
super_ML_work <- super_ML_work(file, metadata_df, train_test_split, number_features, algorithm)

## Alternatively, provide a data frame directly
file <- data.frame(...)
super_ML_work <- super_ML_work(file, metadata_df, train_test_split, number_features, algorithm)
